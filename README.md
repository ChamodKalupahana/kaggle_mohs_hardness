# Kaggle Playground Competition: Regression with a Mohs Hardness Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains my experiments and submissions for the Kaggle Playground competition. The goal of this competition is to explore and test different dense neural network architectures on the provided training and testing datasets. The competition provides a unique opportunity to experiment with various deep learning models and techniques.

## Dataset

- The dataset consists of [describe the dataset and its features].
- Training data: [link to the Kaggle competition dataset page]
- Testing data: [link to the Kaggle competition dataset page]

## Experimentation

I've implemented and tested several dense neural network architectures to find the most effective model for the given task. Each experiment is organized into its own Jupyter Notebook for clarity. The following architectures have been explored:

1. **DNN Model 1: Basic Dense Layers**
    - Architecture: [describe the architecture]
    - Results: [include key metrics and insights]

2. **DNN Model 2: Adding Dropout for Regularization**
    - Architecture: [describe the architecture with dropout layers]
    - Results: [include key metrics and insights]

3. **DNN Model 3: Fine-tuning Hyperparameters**
    - Architecture: [describe the architecture with optimized hyperparameters]
    - Results: [include key metrics and insights]

## Submission

The best-performing model will be submitted to the Kaggle competition for evaluation. Results and leaderboard rankings will be updated accordingly.
